## Who Am I
I am a dedicated disciple of Jesus Christ. I am currently pursuing a degree in Software Engineering at Arizona State University.
I am fluent in Spanish, having learned the language by spending 2 years in southern Chile as a missionary for the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints.

## My Interest
Growing up, I have always enjoyed being around computers, I also enjoy pushing the boundaries of what they can do.

In my early years I would enjoy scrolling through the settings app on my phone, and test out what each setting did. That has grown into an interest in learning the inner workings of computers and ultimately, how to program them.

I also found an interest in Google Sheets and created a spreadsheet to track my finances, car maintenance and other small fun projects. As I began to push the limits of Google Sheets I began to look into programming and what I could do with it.
