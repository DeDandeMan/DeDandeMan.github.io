*Note*: Since doing what you are trying to learn is probably the best way to learn it, this post will serve as what I call my playground, meaning here is where I will try out the different things while I learn how to build a website.

## Who Am I
I am a devout christian, and an aspiring husband, father and software engineer. I enjoy playing the piano, sports and board games.

## My Interest
Growing up, I have always enjoyed being around computers, I also enjoy pushing the boundaries of what they can do.

In my early years I would enjoy scrolling through the settings app on my phone, and test out what each setting did. That has grown into an interest in learning the inner workings of computers and ultimately, how to program them.
